# TensorFlow-Neural-Network-Project
From previous Hackathon work (this time using TensorFlow library), a 4-layer neural network designed to perform binary classification based on 6 input features


## Description
A simple python program that predicts vertebra abnormalities using a neural network.
The neural network has two 10-nodes hidden layers.
The neural network has achieved an accuracy of 86.67% with less than 8 seconds of training time.

The input features are:
1. Pelvic incidence
2. Pelvic tilt
3. Lumbar lordosis angle
4. Sacral slope
5. Pelvic radius
6. Degree of spondylolisthesis
